65,Polenta Bake with Shrimp,"This Southern-inspired single skillet dinner is warming and hearty—like comfort food all grown up. It’s simple and quick enough for a weeknight, and the whole family will be grateful. Whole milk and Parmesan cheese give the polenta an extra dose of creaminess, and plenty of large tail-on shrimp get tossed in paprika and butter for layers of decadent flavor. For maximum charring with minimal hands-on work, the shrimp and cherry tomatoes are broiled before being added to the skillet. Before serving, the dish gets a smattering of fresh scallions for crunch and a bright green pop of color. Get your skillet (and forks) ready.",
